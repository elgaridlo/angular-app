This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0.

## Instalation

Please download node js at first and then you could run `npm install -g @angular/cli`

## When you already install angular
You should run `npm install` to install all dependencies in this project

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## note

Using Firestore library, there is a disadvantage that it's hard to get id of the file and it dont have query to get the data from firebase.
